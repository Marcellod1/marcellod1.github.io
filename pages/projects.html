          A simulation of emergent flocking behaviour of boids (bird-oids) within a 3D environment, rendered with the GIVR library. Each boid
          has three distict radii of awarness, which dictate forces to separate from, align with, and match velocities with
          neighboring boids. These forces are accumulated, and the boid's positions are updated each frame adhering to a
          semi-implicit eulerian integration method. A 3D grid data structure was implemented as a caching solution to optimize the 
          O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm. This optimization allows for the simulation of up to two-thousand boids with a stable frame rate.

          A collection of four mass spring system simulations. This simulation utilizes a semi-implicit integration method to update positions 
          and velocities of each point mass. This integration is performed after the spring, damping, gravitational and collision forces are accumulated 
          for each mass, applying Newton's second and third laws of motion. This series of systems aims to portray the relative simplicity in designing complex 
          mass spring simulations once numerical stability is ensured by correctly applying semi-implicit integration. Across all four simulations, 
          only the initial spring and mass configurations are altered along with a few constants. 
          All systems are simulated by the same algorithm after these initial parameters are set.

          An animation of a roller coaster and track represented by a cubic hermite spline. This spline forms the path of the track in 3D space and is parameterized as a function
          of time, mapping to points along the curve. Practically, this spline was parameterized in terms of arc lengths along the curve using a look-up table. This is to allow for 
          more convinient simulation programming, as for each frame, the distance travelled can be trivially calculated through kinematic equations. The orientation of the track and 
          cart geometry is calculated at each point on the spline through the use of a Frenet Frame. This frame ensures the geometry is oriented such that the centripetal forces 
          due to the track's curvature are cancelled out by the cart's normal force and experiential "centrifugal" force.

        <p class="text-justified">
          A simple animation consisting of objects modelled, rigged, keyframed and rendered in Blender. The objective of this animation is to personify an
          everyday object using common animation principles such as squash and stretch, ease-in-ease-out and anticipation. To portray these principles, the object was
          rigged with a skeleton consisting of many "bones", where each "bone" governs the transformations of model geometry adjacent to it. Fine tuning of bone geometry was 
          performed through Blender's "weight paint" heat map. The resulting animation was rendered with Blender's Eevee rendering engine.

          A 3D arena combat focused driving game developed by a five person team as a term project for CPSC 585: Games Programming. This project was developed with C++, using libraries
          such as OpenGL and Nvidia PhysX. The rendering engine was a responsibility of mine during development, porting boilerplate code from previous University assignments to fit this
          project's scope. The rendering engine included OBJ file loading, shadow map rendering and text rendering with full texture support. Significant optimizations for the rendering were
          a constant concern as the pipeline needed to keep up with the fast-paced gameplay. A distinction between static and dynamic objects, deferred rendering and baked-in shadow textures 
          were utilized in this project.
